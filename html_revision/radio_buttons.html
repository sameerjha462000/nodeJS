<!-- 
  1. In order to connect various radio buttons to the same question we give them the same name. For example in this 
    case we gave them all the name="fav-subject" 
  
  2. Also, if we want that user selects atleast 1 radio button, then we need to mark a radio button checked

  3. Also, when we submit a radio button form, it reads the value as "on". Due to this reason we need to give radio buttons
    a value so that when we receive them on the backend we get a value other than "on"

<form action="">
  <p>Which is your favourite subject</p>
