    Why use a database instead of just saving to a file?

    1. Databases can handle large amounts of data efficiently and store it completely.
    2. They provide tools for easy insertion, querying, and updation of data.
    3. They generally offer security features and control over access to data.
    4. They (generally) scale well.
