    Why are we learning Mongo?

    1. Mongo is very commonly used with Node and Express(MEAN & MERN stacks).
    2. It is easy to get started with (though it can be tricky to truly master).
    3. It plays particularly well with JavaScript.
    4. Its popularity also means there is a strong community of developers using Mongo.
