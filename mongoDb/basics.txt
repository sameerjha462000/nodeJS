1. MongoDb is a NO-SQL database.
2. Databases are primarily of 2 types : SQL database and NoSQL database.
3. In SQL database, a predefined schema is followed and in NoSQL database no such predefined schema is there.
4. MongoDb is a NoSQL database based on document model. It stores data in the form of documents.
5. CRUD is very important part to MongoDb. 
	-- For R, we have two methods find() and findOne(). The find() method returns a cursor to the found result whereas findOne() returns us a single document.
		-- db.dogs.find() // returns us all the dogs
		-- db.dogs.findOne({"name" : "Blue Steele"}) // returns us the first dog whose name is "Blue Steele"
		-- db.dogs.find({age : {$gt : 7}}) // returns us all the dogs who are atleast 8 years old.

	-- For C, we have again two methods, insertOne() and insertMany(). We also have a all-in-one insert method as well
		-- db.dogs.insertOne(
					{
						"name" : "Blue Jha", 
						"age" : 4,
						"personality": {
							"isCatFriendly" : true,
							"isChildrenFriendly": true
						}
					}
				     ) // insertOne method is used to insert a single document into the collection.
		-- db.dogs.insertMany(
					[
						{"name":"Tonya Jha", "age": 5, "lovesAbhishek": false}, 
						{"personality" : {"isCatFriendly" : true,"isChildrenFriendly": false}, "age" : 8}
					]
				     )
	-- For D, we again have two methods, deleteOne() and deleteMany()
		-- db.dogs.deleteOne({age : {$gt : 23}, "personality.isChildrenFriendly" : true}) // delete the first cat whose age is 23 and is children friendly.
		-- db.dogs.deleteMany({age : {$in : [12, 23]}, "personality.isChildrenFriendly" : false}) // delete all the cats who are either 12 or 23 years old and are not 
		   // child friendly.
